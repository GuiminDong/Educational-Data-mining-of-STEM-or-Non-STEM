ASSISTments, developed by researchers years ago,
is a mathematics tutoring system designed for middle school
students. Many middle school students have used this software,
and a fraction of them are now attending colleges. Previously,
researchers created a logistic regression model to predict students’
choice of college majors (STEM or NON-STEM), and
have done some detailed statistical analysis. In this project, we
built models for predicting students’ college majors (STEM or
NON-STEM) by training Support Vector Machine and Multilayer
Perceptron with different combination of features generated
from log files of ASSISTments and achieved higher accuracy,
and constructed Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA)to cluster five different groups by using similar
features from previous research. From the results, we found
that our new set of features selected empirically by ensembled
feature selection method can increase accuracy of our classifier
and makes such feature set more explanatory to predict STEM
or Non-STEM majors enrollment in college, and unsupervised
UPGMA clustered students into five groups providing some
insight of personal characteristics in choosing STEM or Non-
STEM majors.
